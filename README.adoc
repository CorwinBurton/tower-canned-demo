= Ansible Tower Demo

This is a pre-canned demo for an existing tower installation. You need AWX CLI and the associated configurations for it, plus the tower_cli.cfg file for login. See https://galaxy.ansible.com/awx/awx for details on setup.

== Requirements
* vault.yml filling in the variables in the vault-template.yml
* users.yml based on users-template.yml
* The playbooks here: https://github.com/CorwinBurton/tower-demos.git
* Working Tower or AWX install
* Either the ansible.tower collection or the awx.awx collection
** If you use the awx.awx, you need to swap out the collection at the top of the playbooks
